  achievements: 
  - Designed technical architecture for unifying and modernizing two key systems and databases for USMS using a J2EE-based distributed architecture based on EJB, Hibernate, and Swing.  This will provide them a long-term viable and usable platform for business process integration and more sophisticated analysis of criminal activity.
  - Created user interface style guide and a Swing framework in support of it; this allows developers to easily create consistent interfaces regardless of IDE.
  - Conducted requirements gathering using cross-functional domain experts to understand and refine prisoner booking procedures; this system would be the first to completely support all booking policies at an organization-wide level.

  description: Design and develop Java code for US Marshals Service case management and analysis system.  Participate in requirements gathering.  Provide estimates and support project planning.
  achievements: 
  - Successfully completed migration of legacy system to modern, distributed system based on J2EE and Swing.  This system is used daily at USMS and the modernized version provides many usability and workflow enhancements.
  - Successfully migrated technical infrastructure from Weblogic to JBoss.  By designing to standards and going open-source, we saved the USMS significant cost in both licensing and maintenance.
  - Designed and implemented a self-directed training tool and context-sensitive help system using JavaHelp.  Trainers could author, review, and approve content, while users could seamlessly experiment with a "training" version of the application
  - Conducted usability tests with cross-functional users group and revised system based on user feedback.  This was a key achievement in the success of our application and gave us high confidences that we were delivering a more usable product.
  - Standardized development tools and practices by creating a project intranet, Ant-based deployment scripts and a common build environment.  This allowed new developers to be up and running very quickly and ensured accurate knowledge transfer between staff.
  - Created prototype of mobile interface to a USMS criminal search system by re-using EJB-based business logic; standards-compliance and distributed design allowed for very fast prototyping, keeping costs down for the government.
